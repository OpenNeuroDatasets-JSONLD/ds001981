This dataset contains un-processed MRI data from 24 female adult Wistar rats, acquired at the Functional Imaging Laboratory of the German Primate Center (GÃ¶ttingen Germany). The rats were anesthetized with medetomidine for up to six hours. The dataset includes anatomical scans acquired with a T2-weighted TurboRARE sequence (1 per rat) and functional scans (BOLD fMRI) acquired with a gradient-echo EPI sequence. Multiple functional scans were acquired per rat over the anesthesia duration (see [/sub-??/sub-??_scans.tsv]), including scans with electrical forepaw stimulation (task: efs, 283  runs in total) and resting state scans (task: rs, 295 runs in total). The stimulus timing was identical for all efs fMRI runs (see [/task-efs_events.tsv]), except for one ([/sub-07/func/sub-07_task-efs_run-01_events.tsv]). Details can be found in
